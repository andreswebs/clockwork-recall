# Clockwork Recall: a Vibe Code RPG

"Help an amnesiac AI recover it's memories and find out how they were lost..."

An ethnographic experiment to vibe-code an RPG game using AI.

## Context

This started out as a [demo](DEMO.md) at $WORK showing how to add a simple text-file-based memory system to GitHub Copilot.

Initial structure:

```txt
.
├── .github
│   └── copilot-instructions.md
├── .vscode
│   └── settings.json
├── assets
├── learnings
├── src
└── story
```

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: custom instructions for GitHub Copilot
- `.vscode/settings.json`: custom VSCode settings for the project, used to add MCP servers
- `assets`: contains AI-generated game assets
- `learnings`: unedited record of a conversation with ChatGPT about how to generate the game assets
- `src`: this is where we'll keep the source code
- `story`: this is where we'll develop the story and get into the game vibe
