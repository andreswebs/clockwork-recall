I'm creating a an RPG game and I need some assets.
I also need some explanations about how this works, what kind of assets will I need for my game, and how to create the visuals for a character in my game.
My game will be written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with no frameworks.
For now I just want to present a character on the screen.
Give me an explanation and the basic concepts I need to know to plan my game, and then we'll proceed with creating some images.
