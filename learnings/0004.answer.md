To fully represent your character in an RPG game—even a simple one—you’ll eventually want a **set of visual assets** that cover different states or actions (even for NPCs). Let’s break this down step-by-step.

## 🎨 Visual Assets You'll Need for the NPC

For now, assume **static (non-animated)** interaction and **front-facing only**. As the game grows, you can add more complexity.

### ✅ Minimum Assets (Static Presentation)

| Asset                            | Purpose                       | Example Prompt                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Idle Pose** (done ✅)          | Default appearance            | "A pixel art character, front-facing, steampunk male technician wearing a suit and monocle"                                    |
| **Dialogue Portrait (optional)** | Larger version for text boxes | "A pixel art portrait of a steampunk male technician, wearing a suit, monocle, and holding instruments, from the shoulders up" |

### 🔄 Optional But Useful

| Asset Type                | Description                            | Why It's Useful               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Walking Animation**     | 3–4 frames per direction (N/S/E/W)     | For movement                  |
| **Side/Back View**        | For directional orientation            | If your map supports movement |
| **Interaction Animation** | Small movement (nod, blink, gesture)   | Adds personality              |
| **Dead/Injured Pose**     | Optional if NPC can die or be attacked | RPG combat scenes or events   |
| **Sprite Sheet**          | Combines multiple poses in one file    | Efficient rendering/animation |

## 📐 File and Format Recommendations

| Asset Type   | Format | Size (in pixels)   | Notes                        |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Idle Pose    | PNG    | 32x48 or 64x64     | Stick to common sprite sizes |
| Portrait     | PNG    | \~96x96 or 128x128 | Use in UI dialogs            |
| Sprite Sheet | PNG    | Grid               | Align each frame to a grid   |

## 🛠️ How to Generate Each Type Using Prompts

Here are some prompts tailored to each asset type. You can use these with an AI image generator (like DALL·E or others), or create by hand.

### 1. **Idle Sprite**

> "A pixel art character, front-facing, steampunk male technician with a monocle, wearing a dark suit with a belt full of tools, standing idle, 32x48 pixels."

### 2. **Walking Animation (East-facing)**

> "A 4-frame pixel art sprite sheet of a steampunk technician walking to the right, wearing a suit and monocle, tools on his belt, 32x48 pixels per frame."

### 3. **Portrait for Dialogue**

> "A detailed pixel art portrait of a steampunk male technician with a mustache and monocle, wearing a dark suit and holding measuring instruments, shoulders-up view."

### 4. **Back View (Static)**

> "A pixel art character seen from the back, steampunk male technician with dark hair, a toolbelt, and a suit, standing idle."

### 5. **Interaction Animation (Optional)**

> "A 2-frame pixel art animation of a steampunk technician nodding or lifting a tool slightly, wearing a suit and monocle."

## 👣 Next Steps

1. **Start with idle + portrait** to build your UI and static map.
2. **If your game involves map movement**, prioritize:

   - Side and back views
   - Walking animations
   - Sprite sheet with 3–4 frames per direction

Would you like to generate a walking sprite next (side-view, 3–4 frames)? Or would you prefer a dialogue portrait?
