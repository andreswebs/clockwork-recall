## üß† Core Concepts for Planning an RPG Game

Even though you're starting simple (presenting a character), it's helpful to understand the big picture. Here‚Äôs a high-level overview of the types of **assets** and **concepts** you‚Äôll work with.

### 1. **Game Loop (Logic Layer)**

- A core loop runs continuously (or in intervals), updating the game state and re-rendering as needed.
- Even for a static screen (like showing a character), this loop can manage animation or interaction.

### 2. **Game Assets**

You'll need a few types of assets. For now, we‚Äôll focus on **visual assets**, but keep this broader list in mind:

| Type                  | Description                                         | Example                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Character Sprites** | Images of characters in various poses or animations | Walking, idle, attacking    |
| **Tilesets**          | Grid-based images to construct maps                 | Grass, stone, walls         |
| **UI Elements**       | Buttons, menus, health bars                         | ‚ÄúStart Game‚Äù, inventory     |
| **Sound Effects**     | Audio for actions and ambiance                      | Sword swing, footsteps      |
| **Fonts/Text**        | Game-specific text styles                           | Dialogue boxes, menu labels |

### 3. **Rendering Options**

- Since you‚Äôre using HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks), you can render characters with:

  - **HTML elements (e.g., `<img>`, `<div>`)**: easiest to start.
  - **Canvas API**: better for animations and complex scenes later.

## üë§ Presenting a Character on the Screen

### What You‚Äôll Need

1. A **character image** (can be a PNG or sprite sheet).
2. An HTML container (`<div id="game">`) to place the character in.
3. Some basic CSS to size and position it.
4. JavaScript to possibly animate or handle interaction later.

### üõ†Ô∏è Basic Setup Example (Static Character)

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>RPG Character</title>
    <style>
      body {
        margin: 0;
        background: #222;
      }

      #game {
        width: 100vw;
        height: 100vh;
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
      }

      .character {
        width: 128px;
        height: 128px;
        background-image: url("character.png");
        background-size: cover;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="game">
      <div class="character"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Replace `"character.png"` with your actual image path.

## üé® Next Steps: Visual Design for Your Character

### Options for Getting/Creating a Character Image

You can either:

1. **Use premade pixel art** (free assets from OpenGameArt, Itch.io, etc.)
2. **Generate a custom character using AI** (we can do this together)
3. **Create it by hand** in a tool like:

   - Aseprite (pixel art)
   - Piskel (free browser pixel editor)
   - Photoshop, GIMP, or Krita

## ‚úÖ What To Do Now

You said you're ready to create some images. Let‚Äôs start with:

1. **Describe your character**:

   - Gender?
   - Style (fantasy, modern, sci-fi)?
   - Clothing or weapons?
   - Should it be pixel art, cartoon, or realistic?

Once I have this, I can generate a visual for you using AI or guide you to appropriate assets.
