dude, be careful

you actually overwrote an existing file when you did that, and I had to revert it and create the next record pair

my bad I guess, I wasn't clear enough in my instructions

so it's almost working, but the correct procedure should be:

first look at the sequence, and identify the next number in the sequence; then create the record pair with the next number, that is, the pair of files with the new number, as empty files

and then record both my message and yours, in the respective files

for this current message, I have already created the empty files for you, and their number is 0006, so you just need to copy the content into them

for the next interactions, you must continue the sequence from 0007

proceed
