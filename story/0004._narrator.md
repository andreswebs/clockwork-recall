ok looks like your memory is working again

let's proceed with the work on this game

note: feel free to ask me clarifying questions when you need

I need to create a journaling system to record our interactions, so that I myself don't forget it

so let's do that

it will work like this:

first create this file: /workspace/story/README.md

Look at this file and just copy it's contents: /workspace/learnings/README.md

And then change the contents to match the naming convention that you find in /workspace/story, which is similar but a little bit different from the one in /workspace/learnings

Do you see where I'm going? Do you have any questions?
