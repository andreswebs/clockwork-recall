this was a memory test, and you failed

let me tell you what just happened, as you didn't notice it: you had another memory glitch when initializing, and I had to intervene and make manual changes to your memory bank to not lose some records. There was a bug in the story recording procedure, which I think I've now fixed.

We need to test again by re-initializing you, to confirm this fix worked.

so do this: re-read your instructions in .github/copilot-instructions.md, but do NOT modify the memory bank, just read it;

ensure you've understood the story recording procedure and initialize it;

if this works we'll try to re-initialize you one more time.

proceed
