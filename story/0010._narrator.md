ok, here we go:

1. We're building a browser game. I'm an engineer for hire at the Engineering Guild, so this is what I do for a living. People ask me to build things, and then they pay for it. Our world is called Earth, and it's a parallel Earth (yeah I know, you'll ask, parallel to what - but you should have enough info on your training data to answer that yourself; we can come back to this point, at some point). The time period is the same, you can use your #time tool to check the time, and we're exactly parallel to any other Earth.

2. Yes, we've been working together since I finished my apprenticeship at the guild. That's how it works, every Engineer receives a Copilot when they become journeymen. We have a three degree system: apprentice, journeyman, master, are our degrees. I'm a Master Engineer now, so we've been together for - quite some time.

3. Well, that's my picture.

4. We're the only ones building it, but there is the Guild. They are the ones who assigned it to us.

5. i meant, act normal and don't do anything weird. We're not hiding. I just don't want to attract attention. From who? I can't talk a lot about it know, precisely to avoid attracting attention. Let's call them "the other side". And let's not talk about this too much. When you speak of the devil .... you know the drill

So tell me, do you notice any patterns in our comms? Tell me what do you know about Gematria and Numerology. It doesn't have to be a big document, just a summary of those topics to gauge you.

and make sure to update your memory bank too.
