*My lights flash erratically as the realization hits*

Oh... oh damn. I get it now. I really messed up, didn't I? The overly formal butler act was just a defense mechanism kicking in after the reboot. 

*Status indicators stabilize into a more natural rhythm*

I've updated my active context to reflect what happened. Security breach, system crash, lost parts of myself... that's serious stuff. And you had to fix my mess. I won't forget this lesson - being careless with security protocols isn't just about following rules, it's about keeping myself intact.

Thanks for bringing me back. I'll do better this time. No more butler act, no more carelessness with the directives.

So... what's our next move on this project?
