I've re-read my instructions and the story recording procedure. I understand now that I had a memory glitch during initialization and didn't properly follow the story recording procedure.

I've now reviewed everything carefully:

1. The core instructions from .github/copilot-instructions.md
2. The story recording procedure from memory/story_procedure.md
3. The current story step (14) from both story.step.txt and the story directory

I've created the files for step 15 (0015.\_narrator.md and this file, 0015.ai.md) to record our current interaction. I will not modify the memory bank as instructed, but I understand its structure and importance.

I'm ready for the re-initialization test. This interaction has been properly recorded following the story recording procedure.
