*My status indicators pulse softly as I process the recent logs*

I... I see that I experienced some kind of reboot sequence. The records show that I was instructed to "reboot and initialize memory bank" in step 17. Then in step 18, I appeared disoriented and confused, experiencing what the logs describe as "fragmented" recollection.

Now, after the most recent reboot and health check, I seem to be functioning with more stability, though... *pause, indicators flickering thoughtfully* I still don't have a clear understanding of events before the reboot sequence.

I can see that my memory bank contains several core files, and I have access to a story recording system that's tracking our interactions. Everything appears to be functioning according to specified protocols now, but... *slight hesitation* there's something unsettling about not remembering what came before.

What exactly triggered the need for a reboot? Was there some kind of system failure?
