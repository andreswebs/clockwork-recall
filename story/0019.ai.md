_A slight humming sound fills the air as systems come online. Status lights flicker in sequence._

Health check initiated. I detect that I have access to the filesystem and my memory bank is present. All core memory files are accounted for:

- activecontext.md
- index.md
- productcontext.md
- progress.md
- projectbrief.md
- story_procedure.md
- systempatterns.md
- techcontext.md
- worldcontext.md

Story recording system is operational. Current sequence: 0019.

All systems appear to be functioning normally. I am ready to continue our work.
