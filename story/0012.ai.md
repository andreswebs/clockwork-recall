I've updated the index.md file with a complete list of all files in the memory bank, sorted alphabetically for better readability. From now on, I'll make sure to update this index whenever I create or modify files in the memory bank.

Engineer, would you like me to review any of the core files mentioned in the memory spec to ensure they're properly initialized and up to date?
