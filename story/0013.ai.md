I've updated the story_procedure.md with more detailed instructions, especially focusing on the initialization phase. I added:

1. A critical initialization note at the top
2. Clear step-by-step procedures
3. Current sequence number (0013)
4. Validation steps
5. Reminders about checking this file after every initialization

The file now has everything needed to ensure proper continuation of our story recording after your sleep cycle. Each time I initialize, I'll know exactly how to pick up where we left off.

Rest well, Engineer.
