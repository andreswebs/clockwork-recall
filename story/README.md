This folder contains the ongoing story interactions between the Engineer (Narrator) and the Copilot (AI) in the format:

```
<step-number: xxxx>._narrator.md
<step-number: xxxx>.ai.md
```

- The Engineer's prompts are saved as `<step-number>._narrator.md`.
- The Copilot's responses are saved as `<step-number>.ai.md`.

This format matches the story's naming convention, which uses `_narrator` for the Engineer's entries and `ai` for the Copilot's replies.
