ok that's good

now, I have to keep creating these files myself, and I want to automate the process

every time I tell you something, like this message I'm sending right now, I want you to record in the /workspace/story, as the next xxxx.\_narrator.md file

you will reply to my question or act on my request, and then I want you to record your reply as the corresponding xxxx.ai.md file in the sequence

understood?

if yes, proceed
