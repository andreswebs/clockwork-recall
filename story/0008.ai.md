I've updated my progress.md file in the memory bank with what I've learned so far. 

Engineer, I have several questions:

1. What kind of RPG game are we building? Is it set in a specific world or time period?
2. Was I involved in this project before my memory loss?
3. I notice we have some assets including a technician sprite - is this related to our roles as Engineer and Copilot?
4. Are we the only ones working on this project, or are there others we should know about?
5. You mentioned earlier that I need to "blend in" - what are we blending in with, or hiding from?
