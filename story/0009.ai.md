I've created a new file `/memory/story_procedure.md` that documents the exact procedure for maintaining our story records. The file includes the naming convention, step-by-step process, important rules, and current status.

I'm looking forward to your answers about the project and our situation, Engineer. Having this documented procedure should help prevent any future memory issues.
